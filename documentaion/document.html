            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.</br>
               It is a small and lightweight language.</br> Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser)
              JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to</br>
               provide programmatic control over them.</p>
               <br><br>
               <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, 
                and Math, </br>and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures,
                 and statements. Core </br>JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing
                  it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser
                       and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to 
                       place elements on an HTML form 
                      and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                       on a server. For example, server-side extensions provide access to a database and the ability to 
                       use HTTP requests and responses.</li>

                  <h3>Purpose</h3>
                  <section id="purpose">
                    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that is used to make web pages interactive. 
                      It is an interpreted language, which means that it is executed line by line, rather than being compiled into machine code. 
                      JavaScript is a high-level language, which means that it is easy to read and write, and it is designed to be used in conjunction with HTML and CSS.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript is used to create dynamic web pages that can respond to user input, such as mouse clicks and keyboard events. 
                      It can also be used to create animations, validate forms, and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. 
                      JavaScript is an essential part of modern web development, and it is supported by all major web browsers.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for both front-end and back-end development. 
                      It can be used to create web applications, mobile applications, and even desktop applications. 
                      JavaScript is also used in server-side development, where it can be used to create APIs and handle server-side logic.</p>
